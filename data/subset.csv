1932,Mario order still not here. A dirty trick marking it as dispatched when you haven't done so. It stops me cancelling to go elsewhere
1953,where is my shopping?! 😡 could you tell me why I pay delivery charge if the shopping doesn't come in the time slot? I am currently waiting for my shopping to come and the time slot I booked was 7pm to 8pm and it is now 8.11pm.

2832,because you cancelled my delivery today with 10 minutes notice due to a football match taking place a mile away. Here's my invoice for tonight's dinner. £13.50. If you've known the premier league fixtures since June why make the delivery slots available?! #HANGRY https://t.co/A0AvT0HU4o
